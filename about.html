	FRC - FIRST Robotics Competition, a league of high school robotics teams that build robots and compete against each other. This game is a simulation of what the high school teams must do during the robotics competition this year.
	<br><br>
	In this game, you control a robot. The goal of the game is to pickup  yellow cubes and put them on the blue side of one of several see-saws. While there are more cubes on your side of the left or middle see-saws, you get +1 point per second. There is an opponent that will attempt to place cubes on their side of the goals. You have 60 seconds to score more points than your opponent.

	I designed this game in a way that allows it to work on a custom arcade cabinet that was built by a student on the high school robotics team I volunteer at (as a programming teacher). The arcade cabinet has been brought to several of the team's events and used as a show-piece, open to the public.</p>
